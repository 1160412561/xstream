    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p>Benchmark results are always dependent on a very individual setup. Normally it is not useful to generalize such results
    for every use case, but it can give you a hint. However, if you're really in the need of maximum performance, you should
    probably create an own benchmark with your objects or even use a profiler to detect the real hot spots in your application.</p>

	<p>XStream uses the Java Microbenchmark Harness (<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">JMH</a>)
	of the JDK Tools as benchmark framework starting with version 1.4.9. As result it contains a ZIP file
	(xstream-jmh-&lt;version&gt;-app.zip) as new artifact containing anything required to run the benchmarks. Unpack
	the file and use the scripts in the <em>bin</em> directory to execute the benchmarks. Use option -h to look at the
	options	provided by JMH. You may exchange the libraries in the <em>lib</em> directory with other versions of
	XStream or the individual parsers or you may even add new JMH benchmarks to the default ones of XStream.</p>
	
	<p>All benchmark values below measure the average throughput in nanosecond per operation. JMH provides additional
	measurement options, see online help. The maximum deviation for each benchmark is recorded in the reference files
	of	the distributed ZIP file. The benchmark is executed on Linux 4.1.12 Gentoo 64-bit system with an Intel Core i7
	CPU 920 of 2.67 GHz. Note again, that these values are no replacement for real profiler results and they may
    vary from run to run (see reference files) due to this machine's background processes on a single CPU. However, it
    can give you some idea of what you can expect using different parser technologies.</p>
	
    <h2 id="parser">Parser Benchmark</h2>
	
	<p>The values represent the average throughput of 10 runs with a single thread. The benchmarks emphasis the parser
	efficiency for different structures.</p>

      <dd>An implementation that does not cache deserialized String values with the consequence that repeated values

      <dt>Intern</dt>
      <dd>An implementation that uses String.intern() to cache the individual values. The memory pool used for the
      values is dependent on the JDK version. Up to Java 7 this was the permanent generation space i.e. the memory has
      to be shared with all loaded classes. It is up to the garbage collection when these string values are freed
      again.</dd>
      <dt>ConcurrentMap (length limit)</dt>

      <dd>An implementation that uses a ConcurrentHashMap as cache for all strings. The lifetime of the cache is
      equivalent with the lifetime of the XStream instance.</dd>
      <dt>Sync'd WeakCache (length limit)</dt>
      <dd>An implementation that uses a WeakCache for strings of limited length (38 characters). This cache uses weak 
      references for its keys and values. An entry is therefore only kept as long as the deserialized object structure
      is referencing it. This is XStream's default strategy.</dd>
      <dt>Syn'd WeakCache (unlimited)</dt>
      <dd>An implementation that uses a WeakCache for all strings. This cache uses weak references for its keys and

    <dl>
      <dt>No Coding</dt>
      <dd>An implementation that does not encode the names of XML elements. It relies on the fact that the object graph
      does not contain elements with invalid XML names, because the name of the class types and members are either
      conforming or have been aliased.</dd>
      <dt>Dollar Coding</dt>
      <dd>An implementation that uses String.replace to replace any dollar sign with '&xb7;', a valid character
      normally not used for Java identifiers. In typical Java code there are no other invalid characters used for Java
      identifiers, however, Java allows identifiers to contain a wide range of UTF-8 characters and the JVM has even
      less restrictions.</dd>
      <dt>Escaped Underscore Coding</dt>
      <dd>An implementation that uses a StringBuilder to create the XML name by replacing any dollar sign with '_-' and
      escapes every plain underscore with two ones. The implementation will therefore only use characters in the
      standard ASCII range. It is not possible to use a simple minus sign as replacement because it is not a valid
      first character for XML names. However, the comments about Java identifiers and JVM identifiers from the Dollar
      Coding still apply.</dd>
      <dt>Safe Coding</dt>
      <dd>The default implementation of XStream (XmlFriendlyNameCoder) using a StringBuilder and a cache, encoding any
      character that is invalid for XML names. It implements also the underscore escaping for compatibility reasons
      with XML created by earlier versions of XStream.</dd>
